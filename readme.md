# thread_pool

C++11 library for managing a number of threads and executing
a function in parallel in all of the threads.

## Using

Add this repository as a submodule, add `include/` to your
include paths.

```c++
#include <softwear/thread_pool.hpp>
using softwear::thread_pool;

## Reference

See the header file for a detailed API documentation.

In general the API is thread safe in regards to the worker
threads, but the controlling API may only be called by one
thread at the same time.

```c++
struct thread_pool {
  /// Initialize the pool and start the worker threads
  thread_pool(size_t size);
  thread_pool(); /// Auto detecting the number of CPUs
  
  /// Initialize the pool, the workers and run a job
  template<typename F, typename... Args>
  thread_pool(size_t size, F f, Args&&... args);

  /// Wait until all workers are idle then stop the threads.
  ~thread_pool();
    
  /// Move construction and assignment is supported
  thread_pool(thread_pool&&) = default;
  thread_pool& operator=(thread_pool&&) = default;

  /// Copy construction and assignment is not
  thread_pool(const thread_pool&) = delete;
  thread_pool& operator=(const thread_pool&) = delete;

  /// Run a job; waits until the pool is idle before
  // running the job; usually stores a copy of the Callable, except when
  /// std::ref is used; other than the std::thread this will
  /// *not* store decay copies of arguments that are references
  template<typename Callable, typename... Args>
  void run(Callable f, Args&&... args);

  /// Check whether the last job has compleeted on all threads
  bool idle();

  void join(); /// Wait till the pool is idle


  size_t size(); /// How many threads there are

  Iterator begin(); /// Iterating the threads
  Iterator end();
}
```

## Testing

Run `make`
